### Building a Jar

`gradlew jar` / `./gradlew jar`

### Installing

Place the output jar from the step above in your server's `config/mods` directory and restart the server.
Create a folder called `mindisco` next to the mod.
Add a `token.txt` file to that folder, making sure that the contents of the file is your discord bot's token.
You can list your currently installed plugins/mods by running the `mods` command.
